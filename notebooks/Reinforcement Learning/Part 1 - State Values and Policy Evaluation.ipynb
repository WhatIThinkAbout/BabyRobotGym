    "In very simple terms, Reinforcement Learning can be thought of as learning from trial and error. An <b><i>agent</i></b>, that interacts with its <b><i>environment</i></b>, receives <b><i>rewards</i></b> that reflect its ability to accomplish some predefined goal. By evaluating how the agent's actions impact on its performance, and then modifying those actions to improve performance, Reinforcement Learning can progressively move towards an agent that gives the maximum amount of reward and that solves the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning can therefore be considered to consist of two distinct parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The <b><i>Prediction Problem</i></b>, in which the performance of the agent is evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The <b><i>Control Problem</i></b>, where the policy, used by the agent to select its actions, is modified to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part we'll mainly consider the prediction problem. Then, once we are able to measure how actions relate to the amount of reward received, we can turn our attention to improving the policy, to maximise those rewards.\n",

Only then, once they have all the theory in place, will they show how that theory can be applied to practical applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this article we'll take the opposite approach. We'll start with very simple methods of practically solving very simple problems and gradually build on these, adding the bits of theory as required, until we're able to solve the full reinforcement learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we'll end up in the same place as a traditional course, but by using a <i>top-down</i> approach, rather than the standard <i>bottom-up</i> method. We want to get Baby Robot back to his mum as quickly as possible, so don't have time to learn all the theory up-front, instead we'll add it as we go!"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental concept in Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the concept of a <b><i>reward</i></b>: a single numerical value that is used to measure how well the task at hand has been performed. It is the reward that drives learning, allowing a problem solving strategy to be optimised to give the maximum reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "In problems such as this one, in which Baby Robot must find his way out of a level, a reward could be given simply for reaching the exit, however that doesn't fully describe what we want to achieve. We actually want to get to the exit in the shortest amount of time. Giving a reward just for reaching the exit doesn't encourage this behaviour. Baby Robot could spend days walking around the level before finding the exit and would receive exactly the same amount of reward as he would for proceeding there directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore a better reward system would be one that encourages taking the shortest route and that discourages wandering around aimlessly. Effectively we want to express the reward as a penalty, that increases with the number of steps taken to reach the exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we also still want to stick with RL's central idea of maximising rewards and so we introduce the idea of negative rewards. For each step taken we give a reward of -1. Therefore a route that takes a long time to find the exit will accumulate a large negative reward and one that goes there directly will have a small negative reward. In terms of getting the most reward, the direct route will be better since it will be less negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## States\n",
    "\n",
    "With our reward system, each time Baby Robot moves from one square to the next he will be given a reward of -1. In RL terminology, each of these squares represents a <b><i>State</i></b>, where a state is defined to be a unique, self-contained, stage in the <b><i>Environment</i></b> that we're working in. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this case, each state describes a position within the grid that forms the level. In a game, such as chess, the state would describe the current board position. In the case of a self-driving car the state could describe properties such as the position on the road, the direction and speed of the car and details of other traffic. In each case the state defines the current situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state is self-contained in the respect that it is independent of any previous states. For example, in chess, the state given by the current board position is independent of all other moves that have been made up to that point. To choose the next move you don't need to know which moves were made in the past. Similarly, for Baby Robot to move from one square to the next in the grid, he doesn't need to know which states he was previously in. When a state is independent of the prior states it is said to satisfy the <b><i>Markov Property</i></b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Value\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that a penalty (reward) of -1 is incurred each time Baby Robot moves from one state to the next, and we also have the luxury of being able to see the map of the level, we can help Baby Robot to make his choice by calculating the <b><i>value</i></b> of each state, where the value defines how good it is to be in a particular state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously it's better to be in a state that's close to the exit than it is to be in one that's far away. In RL the value of a state is defined to be the expected reward that can be obtained when starting in that state and then proceeding to choose actions that are defined by a plan, or <b><i>policy</i></b>, in all future states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add this information to the level. Starting at the exit (which in RL is referred to as the <b><i>Terminal State</i></b>, where the episode ends and which, by definition, is given a reward value of zero), and working our way around the level, incurring a penalty of -1 each time we move to a new square, gives the following values for each state:  "

So, from the initial position, we'd choose to go South to a state with a value of -3, rather than going North to one with a value of -5. The strategy used to select the next action is known as the <b><i>policy</b></i>. \n",
    "In this case if we choose to move in the direction of increasing value we are actually following the best or <b><i>optimal</b></i> policy and, as we saw for __[Multi-Armed Bandits](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-armed-bandits-part-1-b8d33ab80697)__, when we choose to take the action that gives us the highest amount of immediate reward we are said to be choosing greedily.

    "\n",
    "Firstly we've said that Baby Robot receives a <i>reward</i> when he takes an action in a state. Unsurprisingly we use the first letter of each of these terms to refer to its corresponding value, with lower-case being used to refer to specific values for each of these quantities, which gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "* r = reward\n",
    "* a = action\n",
    "* s = state\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, when Baby Robot takes an action he'll most likely move from his current state to another state. The next or <i>successor</i> state is denoted by s′ (read as \"s prime\"):\n",

    "<br/><br/><i>When Baby Robot takes action ”a” he moves from the current state “s” to a new state “ s’ ” and receives reward “r”.</i></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The rewards, states and actions are actually random variables: there's a probability of getting a certain reward, taking a specific action or being in a certain state and these probabilities are referred to using capital letters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tying all these terms together gives us the expected reward for a state-action pair:\n",

    "<center><img src=\"images/equation_1.png\" style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\"/>\n",
    "<br/><i>Equation 1: expected reward for state-action pair</i></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, at time 't -1', starting in a particular state 's' and taking action 'a', the expected reward that's received at the next time step is a function of the current state and action. The reason it's an expected reward is because the amount of reward that's received, when repeatedly taking a particular action in a particular state, may not always return a constant value and so this effectively defines the mean value that will be obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these terms we can create equations for the basic properties we've defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><i>Return 'Gₜ'</b></i>: the total amount of reward accumulated over an episode.\n",
    "In our case an episode refers to all the time steps that occur between entering and exiting a level. (Things obviously get a bit more complicated in long-running or continuous tasks, but we'll come back to that later).\n",

    "<center><img src=\"images/return.png\"/>\n",
    "<br/><br/><i>Starting in state ‘Sₜ’, the return ‘Gₜ’ is the total reward received from that state, until the episode terminates.</i></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<i><b>Value</b>: the value of a state is just a measure of how good it is to be in that state.</i> \n",
    "This can be expressed in terms of the amount of future reward or, in other words, the return that you're likely to receive if you start in that state. Obviously, no matter which state you start in, the rewards you'll receive will depend on the actions you choose and these actions are determined by the <b><i>Policy</b></i>, which is commonly denoted by the symbol 'π'.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the value for state 's' under policy π is simply the expected return:\n",

    "<center><img src=\"images/equation_3.png\" style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\"/>\n",
    "<br/><i>Equation 3: the value of state 's' under policy 'π'.</i></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw, when following a greedy policy, in every state Baby Robot will simply choose to take the action that gives him the highest immediate reward. In most cases this results in a state only having a single possible action. When more than one action exists taking any of the possible actions will result in moving to a state of equal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, since in our simple case, we always get the same reward of -1 for taking an action, the value of a state is simply the immediate reward plus the value of the next state:\n",

    "<center><img src=\"images/equation_4.png\" style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\"/>\n",
    "<br/><i>Equation 4: The value of state 's' under a deterministic policy 'π'.</i></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the value of the start state of the level is -4. If the optimal policy is followed from this state Baby Robot will have accumulated a total reward of -4 by the time he reaches the exit. Similarly, if he chooses to take a single step South from the initial state, he'll receive a reward of -1 for taking the action and the value of the next state is -3, so again this give the value of the initial state as -4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the calculation of the state value is split into two parts; the immediate reward achieved by taking the action and the value of the state where that action takes you. This technique of splitting a problem into sub-problems is known as _**Dynamic Programming**_. Using this, state values that have already been calculated can be reused when calculating the values of other states whose actions lead there. \n",
    "\n",
    "This greatly simplifies the problem, since you don't need to work out the reward that will be given at every state when calculating the total return obtained between a starting state and the end of the episode. Instead you only need to look ahead one step.\n",

Additionally, the value of each state is much lower than under the optimal policy. However, although the state values are much worse, in terms of the reward that can be obtained, they do still give one important bit of information: the relative goodness of each state.\n",

So, on average it will take 32 moves to reach the exit from this point. Similarly, for the square immediately to the North of the start position, the expected reward is -35 and to the South it's -27. Therefore its easy to see that, to get to the exit in the shortest number of steps, its better to head South from the starting square.\n",

    "By repeating this one-step look ahead, and acting greedily with respect to the value of the next state, we can modify the stochastic coin toss policy to create a policy that moves in the direction of the greatest reward.

A more realistic scenario is when these values aren't available and some exploration is required to solve the problem.
